# Settings

Application settings are used as defaults in new interactions. 

Depending on the setup, users may be allowed to change some of those settings during the interaction to customize their experience.

The application `settings` field offers those options:

```yaml

# Users must login to use the application
login: true

# An id from repository.avatar
avatar: my_avatar

# An id from repository.background
background: my_background

# language used in the interaction
language: en-GB

# skip welcome message on interaction start
skipWelcomeMessage: true

# define a prompt for the application, used as main context for the interaction
prompt:
  text: <application context prompt>

# customize the kiosk UI colors, CSS compatible syntax

  primaryBgColor: "purple"
  primaryTextColor: "black"
  secondaryBgColor: "#CCCCCC"
